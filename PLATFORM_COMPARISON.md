## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION: Keep Your Custom LMS**

### **Why Your Current System is BETTER:**

#### **✅ Restaurant-Specific Features:**

- **File Attachments per Lesson** - documents, videos, audio
- **Progress Tracking by User** - exactly what you need
- **Department Categories** (Kitchen, FOH, Safety, etc.)

#### **✅ Cost Comparison:**
```
Your Custom LMS: $0-20/month (Vercel hosting + storage)
HighLevel: $297/month (Unlimited plan needed for courses)
```

#### **✅ Full Control:**
- Customize exactly for restaurant training
- Add features as you need them
- No monthly subscription dependency
- Can white-label and sell to other restaurants
