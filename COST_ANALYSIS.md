### **Current Setup (Local Storage):**
- **Cost:** $0/month
- **Suitable for:** Small teams accessing same server
- **Limitation:** Not cloud-deployable, single point of failure

### **Cloud Storage Options:**

## 1. **Vercel Blob (RECOMMENDED for you!)**
```
âœ… FREE TIER: 10GB storage + 100GB bandwidth/month
âœ… Pay-as-you-scale: $0.15/GB storage + $0.15/GB bandwidth  
âœ… Zero setup - works instantly with Vercel deployment
âœ… Perfect for your use case
```

**For 50 staff uploading 100MB/month each:**
- Storage needed: ~5GB/month
- Bandwidth: ~10GB/month  
- **TOTAL COST: $0/month** (well under free limits!)

## 2. **Cloudinary (Actually VERY affordable!)**
```
âœ… FREE TIER: 25GB storage + 25GB bandwidth/month
âœ… $89/month for 100GB storage + 100GB bandwidth
âœ… Automatic image optimization saves bandwidth
```

**You thought it was expensive, but it's actually generous:**
- **Your usage:** ~5GB storage + 10GB bandwidth = **$0/month!**

## 3. **AWS S3**
```
âœ… $0.023/GB/month storage + $0.09/GB bandwidth
âœ… Most scalable but requires setup
```

**Your cost:** ~$0.15/month total
